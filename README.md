## Description

This is my first coding project, so I hope it stays here because it will have sentimental value for me, but it will also show me where I've been and where I'll be soon.

## Technologies used:
- HTML
- JavaScript
- CSS
- BEM convention
- Normalize
- GIT

## CSS:
This folder is divided into 5 files : header.css, navigation.css, section.css, style.css and table.css. Each of them steels individual elements on the page.

## JavaScript:
In this folder there is a script.js file in which an algorithm is written that converts the Polish currency (PLN) into other currencies ountries such as the USA, Colombia and the euro, which is the official currency in 20 EU countries.

## README
Readme will evolve with the project. Be sure to check back here often to stay up to date.
